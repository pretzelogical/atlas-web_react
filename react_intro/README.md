# react_intro

React development first with create-react-app then with webpack

TODO: testing on the last task doesnt work, most likely because enzyme doesnt have a react 18 version (using an unofficial buggy version) and jest doesnt support esm and it's not like they've been in js since like 2015 so i have to launch node with an experimental flag :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDdd
